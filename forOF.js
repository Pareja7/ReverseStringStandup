//The For...of statement in JS used to execute a certain piece of code for each distinct item(property) of an iterable object.
//it runs through each character in text and appends it to the beginning of new variable (newStr)which we return w/ reversed string. My note: Looping must start from end to make that happen.

//function reverse String(text){
  //declare an empty variable
  //let newStr = ""
  
  //for (char of newStr){
    //newStr = char + newStr
  //}

  //return newStr
//}
